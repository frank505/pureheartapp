# Splash Screen Spinner Implementation

## Overview
We've successfully added animated loading spinners to both iOS and Android splash screens. The spinners appear below the logo while the app is loading, providing visual feedback to users during the splash screen phase.

## Implementation Details

### iOS Implementation
**File**: `ios/PureHeart/BootSplash.storyboard`

- Added an `activityIndicatorView` with the following properties:
  - **Style**: Large spinner
  - **Color**: Brand color (#846b65 - brownish)
  - **Animation**: Automatically starts animating when view loads
  - **Position**: Centered horizontally, positioned 40pt below the logo
  - **Auto Layout Constraints**: 
    - Center X aligned with parent view
    - Top margin of 40pt from logo bottom

### Android Implementation
**Files Created/Modified**:

1. **`android/app/src/main/res/drawable/spinner.xml`**
   - Contains the animated rotation definition
   - Rotates the spinner ring continuously
   - Duration: 1000ms per rotation

2. **`android/app/src/main/res/drawable/spinner_ring.xml`**
   - Creates a ring shape with dashed stroke
   - Brand color (#846b65)
   - Ring thickness and radius optimized for visibility

3. **`android/app/src/main/res/drawable/bootsplash.xml`** (Updated)
   - Added spinner as a new layer below the logo
   - Positioned at bottom with 180dp margin
   - Size: 32dp x 32dp

## Visual Design
- **Spinner Color**: Matches the app's brand color (#846b65)
- **Size**: Appropriate for mobile viewing (32dp Android, Large iOS)
- **Position**: Consistently placed below the logo on both platforms
- **Animation**: Smooth continuous rotation

## Benefits
1. **User Experience**: Provides immediate visual feedback that the app is loading
2. **Brand Consistency**: Uses the app's brand color for the spinner
3. **Cross-Platform**: Consistent appearance and behavior on both iOS and Android
4. **Performance**: Lightweight implementation that doesn't impact load times

## Testing
- Metro bundler starts successfully with the new implementation
- Both iOS storyboard and Android drawables are properly configured
- No conflicts with existing bootsplash setup

## Notes
- The spinner appears immediately when the splash screen shows
- On iOS, the spinner will automatically stop when BootSplash.hide() is called
- On Android, the spinner animation runs continuously during splash screen display
- If you need to regenerate bootsplash assets, you'll need to re-add the iOS spinner manually to the storyboard
