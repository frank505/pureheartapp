### Notification Flow:
1. Backend detects explicit content → sends push notification
2. User taps notification → app opens to specific ImageDetail screen
3. Partner can review, comment, and take accountability actions

3. **Partner Notification**: Backend triggers → push notification → app navigation
4. **Report Viewing**: API fetch → list display → detail navigation
5. **Partner Actions**: Comment/cancel streak → API call → UI update → notification
